# The Wall

## Project Description

"The Wall" is a project created as part of our annual performance check at our company. In this task, we were challenged to record a nonstop video (without cuts or edits) of us creating a full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, but this time using MySQL within a strict time constraint of less than 2 hours. Additionally, the project required full session-cookie management and custom form validation.
